# Miyori
Miyori is an agentic AI project built in Python.

## Project Overview
An experimental framework for building conversational AI agents using custom implementations rather than off-the-shelf solutions. This project is a hands-on learning environment for building core AI functionality from scratch - memory systems, tool integration, and persistent state.

## Design Principles

### 1. Modular Architecture
Components like language models, tools, and memory systems can be swapped out while the agent maintains continuity. This allows experimentation and improvement without losing the agent's accumulated knowledge or context.

### 2. Voice-First Design
Built for natural voice conversation and comfortable, human-like interactions. The agent needs to interpret potentially vague spoken instructions confidently and keep the conversation flowing, which shapes how it interacts and makes decisions.

### 3. Autonomous Operation
The agent uses tools proactively to work toward goals. Instead of waiting for step-by-step instructions, it interprets objectives and figures out how to achieve them.

## Project Goals

The main goal is **continuous improvement** - the agent works to expand its own capabilities, knowledge, and effectiveness over time.

### Self-Referential Development
The agent can work on its own code, documentation, and memory system. When it improves these components, it directly improves itself - creating a feedback loop.

### Persistent Memory
The agent remembers across sessions, building on previous work and maintaining context over time. This creates continuity rather than starting fresh each conversation.

## Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates practical experience with:
- Agentic AI system architecture
- RAG implementation and optimization
- Semantic search and vector databases
- API integration and tool design
- State management in conversational AI
- Autonomous task execution frameworks
