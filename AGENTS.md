Voice-activated AI assistant with modular, interface-based architecture.

**Read `ARCHITECTURE.md` first** - it contains all conventions, design decisions, and extension patterns.

## Quick Start
- Interfaces define contracts in `src/interfaces/`
- Implementations in `src/implementations/`
- All config in `config.json` at root
- Check for `FEATURE_*.md` files for active work
